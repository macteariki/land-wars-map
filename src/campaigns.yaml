    # Northern War: 1845&mdash;46
    
    The Northern war arose out of tension between the government and
    Ngapuhi that resulted from the different understandings of the Crown&apos;s
    sovereignty and ‘te tino rangatiratanga’.

    # Wellington: 1846

    Agreements between the _New Zealand Company_ and Wellington Māori over
    land purchases and settlements made in 1839 were characterised by confusion
    and uncertainty. Ngati Toa chief Te Rangihaeata supported Māori opposed to 
    settlement and by 1846 the tensions resulted in conflict.

    # Whanganui 1847

    Whanganui was also a _New Zealand Company_ settlement where confusion and
    uncertainty over land purchases contributed to tension between settler and
    Māori. The conflict in Whanganui also incorporated longstanding rivalries
    between upriver and lower-river Māori.

    # Taranaki 1860&mdash;64
    
    Settlers in New Plymouth wanted access to more Māori land and while a few Māori chiefs
    were open land sales most were not. A block of land was sold in 1860 and non-violent
    attempts by other Māori to prevent the land being surveyed precipitated the conflict. By
    1865 virtually all of Taranaki had been confiscated.

    # Waikato 1863&mdash;64

    The Kīngitanga movement in the Waikato was the core of Māori resistance to selling land 
    and regarded as the source of the conflict the government was having other parts of
    New Zealand.

    A large number of British soldiers had been assembled and a military road was constructed
    south from Auckland. An ultimatum was issued to Waikato Māori on 11 July 1863, but the invasion
    commenced the next day - before the ultimatum could even reach its audience.
