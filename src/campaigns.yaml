    # Northern War: 1845&mdash;46
    
    The Northern war arose out of tension between the government and
    Ngapuhi that resulted from the different understandings of the Crown&apos;s
    sovereignty and ‘te tino rangatiratanga’.

    # Wellington: 1846

    Agreements between 'The New Zealand Company' and Wellington Māori over
    land purchases and settlements made in 1839 were characterised by confusion
    and uncertainty. Ngati Toa chief Te Rangihaeata supported Māori opposed to 
    settlement and by 1846 the tensions resulted in conflict.
